<br>

Hello! My name is Robert Neagu. Currently, I am a graduate student at Baruch College majoring in Quantitative Methods and Models. I expect to graduate on December 2026. 
<br><br>

My desired fields of employment range from an AI/ML engineer to being a data scientist or analyst. I have great interest working in the technology industry given its rapid developments and my passion with tinkering computers.
<br><br>

Some fun facts about me are my passion of studying nature's animals and trees, cycling through parks, and staying up to date with cutting edge computer technology.
<br><br><br>
