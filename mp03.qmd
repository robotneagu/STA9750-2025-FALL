# 📚Introduction
Many New Yorkers do not appreciate the trees that benefit them and their environment on a daily basis. Over **1 million trees** (specifically 1,093,439 trees) are spread across the Big Apple yet only litter is scattered through most of them. Such people do not consider that these trees are essential for reducing CO2 exposure, provide shelter for birds and squirrels, and provide shade while giving the tree sunlight to grow.

While this project is not meant to start a "stop litter" movement, it analyzes trees and their corresponding district to make a proposal for the NYC Parks Department. Specifically, the goal is to create a new program on why action must be taken in a _specific district_ addressing its trees using visualizations gathered from official NYC data websites.

# 💽Download NYC City Council District Boundaries
Data was collected from the [NYC Department of Planning](https://www.nyc.gov/content/planning/pages/resources/datasets/city-council) using the latest release as of making this project, **25C**. The *shoreline version* will be collected as it can display more trees compared to the the water area version.

```{r}
#| code-summary: "Downloading the Boundary Data"
#| output: false

#The following code was inspired from how we inject data from mp02

#Create directory, if it does not exist already, to store data
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp03"))){
    dir.create(file.path("data", "mp03"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

library <- function(pkg){
    ## Mask base::library() to automatically install packages if needed
    ## Masking is important here so downlit picks up packages and links
    ## to documentation
    pkg <- as.character(substitute(pkg))
    options(repos = c(CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
    if(!require(pkg, character.only=TRUE, quietly=TRUE)) install.packages(pkg)
    stopifnot(require(pkg, character.only=TRUE, quietly=TRUE))
}

#Define zip file name to indicate whether it will exist
zip_name <- "nycc_25c.zip"

url_path <- "https://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/dcp/assets/files/zip/data-tools/bytes/city-council/nycc_25c.zip"

#Zip file path
zip_path <- "./data/mp03/"

#Downloads the required file into the correct directory
if(!file.exists(glue(zip_path, zip_name))){
  download.file(url = url_path, destfile = paste0(zip_path, "/", zip_name), mode = "wb")
}

}


#Read shp file and store it as the data variable
DATA <- sf::st_read(paste0(unzipped_pathname, "nycc.shp"))


#Transform result into WGS 84
DATA <- st_transform(DATA, crs="WGS84")
```

```{r}
#| code-summary: Raw District Boundary Data Output

#Returning transformed DATA to user
datatable(DATA, style = "bootstrap5", caption = "Raw Data Output")
```

:::{.callout-note title = "Explaining the Table"}
*Note: column names were left untouched to show raw data. It may be difficult to understand at first glance.*

The datatable may look scary but provides important information later on. Most notably are columns *Shape_Leng* showing total length of a district in NYC and *Shape_Area* showing how large the district is. Currently, there are **51 districts** to work with.

:::{.callout-tip title = "Data Made Easier"}
The visualization below makes it much easier to see where trees are being looked at. More specifically, it shows the **5 boroughs** of the NYC metropolitan area with a boundary acting as a district.

# 💽Download NYC Tree Points

Since this project focuses on trees, data containing tree location is used as a main metric. The code below downloads the necessary data.
```{r}
#| code-summary: "Downloading the Tree Data"

#The following code is a modified version of data acquisition from https://michael-weylandt.com/STA9750/archive/AY-2024-SPRING/miniprojects/mini01.html

    write_csv(ALL_DATA, "data/mp03/nyc_tree_locations.csv")
}
```

# 🗺Mapping️️ NYC Trees

Now that the necessary data has been collected, a visualization will be made to display:

- Density of trees in a district
- Exact locations of trees
- Health of each tree

The visualization will serve as a starting point at which area(s) should be addressed with the best possible reasons.

```{r}

ggplotly(tree_plot)
```

:::{.callout-note title = "Notes on the Visualization"}
*Note: The graph contains the first 30000 as points trees due to hardware limitations. The statements below only reflect this visualization and could change afterwards.*

Within the 5 boroughs, **Staten Island** has the greatest density of trees yet most of these trees have an unknown or dead status. The Bronx has a large quantity of trees rated in excellent condition likely due to being far away from the JFK airport and being a starting point outside the metropolitan area. Manhattan also has many trees above the first bottom district, either representing an act was made to plant more trees or is simply used as decoration to attract tourists. This is an interactive graph, explore other areas to find different results!

# 🌲District-Level Analyses of Trees

With the tree points and district boundaries now connected to one data table, more analysis can be done besides looking at the visualization. For instance, it is must easier to determine which district had the most amount of trees instantly, not having to second guess our answer when doing this visually.

Note that _all trees_ will be included in the following analyses.
```{r}
#| show: false
#Remove datasets that repeat tree data. Also remove redundant values
rm(tree_data, tree_data_parsed, unzipped_pathname, url_path, DATA, boundaries, zip_name, zip_path, ALL_DATA)
```
## Finding District with Most Trees

```{r}
#| code-summary: "District with most trees"
#Find the district with the most trees
tree_counts <- all_data |>
  group_by(CounDist) |>
  summarise(tree_count = n(), .groups = 'drop') |>
  mutate(
  Borough = case_when(
    CounDist >= 1  & CounDist <= 10 ~ "Manhattan",
    CounDist >= 11 & CounDist <= 18 ~ "Bronx",
    CounDist >= 19 & CounDist <= 32 ~ "Queens",
    CounDist >= 33 & CounDist <= 48 ~ "Brooklyn",
    CounDist >= 49 & CounDist <= 51 ~ "Staten Island",

  datatable(style = "bootstrap5", caption = "Top 10 Districts With The Most Trees")
  
```

:::{.callout-note title="Findings"}
**Council District 51** in Staten Island has the most trees with **70965** recorded. Oddly enough, Staten Island also ranks 2nd and 6th for having the most trees, possibly indicating it is tree dense with so many trees in one borough (Staten Island only has 3 districts).

Many Council Districts for Queens also appear, alluding that there is a good chance trees will be seen whichever neighborhood one enters.

## District with Highest Tree Density

```{r}
#Use the Shape_Area column to act as the density maker per district
density_trees <- all_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  group_by(CounDist) |>
    summarise(
    Shape_Area = first(Shape_Area),  # or sum()/mean() if appropriate
    .groups = "drop"
  ) |>
  left_join(
    tree_counts |>
      st_drop_geometry() |>
      select(CounDist, tree_count, Borough) |>
      distinct(CounDist, .keep_all = TRUE),  # Remove duplicate CounDist rows
    by = "CounDist"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    area_sqkm = as.numeric(Shape_Area) / 1e6,
    tree_density = tree_count / area_sqkm
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(tree_density)) |>
  drop_na() |>
  select(CounDist, Borough, tree_count, area_sqkm, tree_density)
  

density_trees |>
  format_titles() |>
  rename("Council District" = Coundist) |>
  rename("Area (sqkm)" = "Area Sqkm") |>
  rename("Tree Density (sqkm)" = "Tree Density") |>
  datatable(style = "bootstrap5", caption = "Top 10 Districts With Most Dense Trees") |>
  formatRound(c("Area (sqkm)", "Tree Density (sqkm)"), digits = 3)

```
:::{.callout-note title="Findings"}
**Council District 7** in Manhattan has the most dense trees with **283.549 per sqkm** recorded. Despite having a near top tree count of *15,000*, Council District 7 is the *4th smallest District* in all of the NYC metropolitan area and managed to cram the most trees in one place doing so. Compared to the largest district 50 in Staten Island, it has a tree density of about 78 sqkm, likely due to the size of the district.

Manhattan is a borough that excels in density as it crams in whatever it can into the most popular borough worldwide, appearing 5 times in the top 10 list. Having this mindset could also be a reason districts in Manhattan did so well in this category.

## District with Most Amount of Dead Trees

```{r}
#Calculating statistics for dead trees
dead_trees <- all_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  filter(!is.na(Condition), !is.na(CounDist)) |>
  group_by(CounDist) |>
  summarize(total_trees = n(),
            total_dead_trees = sum(Condition == 'Dead', na.rm = TRUE),
            fraction_dead_trees = total_dead_trees / total_trees * 100,
            .groups = 'keep') |>
    left_join(
    tree_counts |>
      st_drop_geometry() |>
      select(CounDist, Borough) |>
      distinct(CounDist, .keep_all = TRUE),
    by = "CounDist"
  ) |>
  select(CounDist, Borough, total_trees, total_dead_trees, fraction_dead_trees) |>
  arrange(desc(fraction_dead_trees))

dead_trees |>
    rename("Council District" = CounDist) |>
    format_titles() |>
    rename("Fraction Dead Trees %" = "Fraction Dead Trees") |>
    datatable(style = "bootstrap5", caption = "Dead Tree Data") |>
    formatRound("Fraction Dead Trees %", digits = 3)

```
:::{.callout-note title="Findings"}
**Council District 32** in Queens has the highest percent of dead trees compared to the rest of its trees with about **14.255%** of trees being dead. A reason for this could be that Queens generally does not receive attention like Manhattan would; paired with being a very large borough leads to more required maintenance. District 32 does land in the *top 10 of most amount of trees* in the district, explaining there is a ton of work to fix those trees. 

What's interesting is that Brooklyn had no districts in this category, showcasing it either has fewer trees than Queens or is capable to maintain them more effectively.

## Finding the Most Common Tree Species in Manhattan
```{r}
manhattan_species <- all_data |>
  st_drop_geometry() |>
  left_join(
    tree_counts |>
      st_drop_geometry() |>
      select(CounDist, Borough) |>
      distinct(CounDist, .keep_all = TRUE),
    by = "CounDist"
  ) |>
  filter(Borough == "Manhattan") |>
  group_by(genusspecies) |>
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'keep') |>
  arrange(desc(count))
  
  manhattan_species |>
    head(50) |>
    rename("Species" = genusspecies) |>
    format_titles() |>
    datatable(style = "bootstrap5", caption = "Most Common Manhattan Trees")
```
:::{.callout-note title="Findings"}
The most common tree species in Manhattan is the **Thornless honeylocust** with **17310** appearances. This appears to be a very common tree across Manhattan as the next most common, the London planetree has about 6000 *fewer* appearances. Trees quickly go to 4 digits, then 3 digits for total appearance, suggesting the Thornless honeylocust may live longer, can adapt to the industrial standards of Manhattan, and actually thrive compared to other species. More statistics would be needed to verify such a claim.
